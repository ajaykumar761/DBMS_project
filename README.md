The Rail Pass Management System is a database management system (DBMS) designed to streamline and optimize the administration of railway passes. This system exclusively serves the administrative needs, providing a secure and efficient platform for creating, editing, updating, and deleting railway passes. Additionally, the system enables administrators to manage and adjust pass pricing. The project leverages modern database technologies to ensure data integrity, security, and accessibility, aiming to enhance operational efficiency and reduce manual errors in railway pass management.
